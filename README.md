# Statistical-Project---Module-2
This Project contempls a database with all the information from my guesthouse located in Lisbon for the years of 2017 - 2019. The database has a lot of information regarding the Number of reservations, Number of guests, Number of nights the guests stayed in Lisbon,, Gender, , Nationality, Check-in and Check out dates, Prices, Months, Reviews and Types of Rooms. Itâ€™s a nice sample of a population which is tourists in Lisbon, useful and accessible to compute statistical models and Hypothesis testing. In this project we will start with the data analysis of the database and after apply some Hypothesis testing.
